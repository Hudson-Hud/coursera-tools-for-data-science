# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook I will briefly present some to be used to aid the study in Data Science

# **Objectives:**
# 
# - List popular languages for Data Science.
# - Describe the stages of the Data Science process.
# - Identify the main Python libraries for Data Science.

# I will list Some of the most popular programming languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 
# **1 - Python** - Preferred and used by about 83% of Data Science professionals.
# 
# **2 - R** - Designed for statistical computing.
# 
# **3 - C/C++** - Compiled, with great efficiency in data processing.
# 
# **4 - Java** - One of the most popular languages.
# 
# **5 - JavaScript** - Currently, the most used language in the world.
# 
# **6 - Julia** - Designed for agile implementation of mathematical concepts.
# 
# **7 - Scala** - Multiparadigm language.

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:

# 1- Pandas - Data analysis library that provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
# 
# 
# 2- Numpy- Library for scientific computing that provides support for multidimensional arrays and matrices.
# 
# 
# 3- Matplotlib - Library for data visualization in Python.
# 
# 
# 4- Scikit-learn - Python machine learning library.
# 
# 
# 5- TensorFlow - Open source machine learning library developed by the Google Brain Team.
# 
# 
# 6- Keras - Deep learning library written in Python.
# 
# 
# 7- PyTorch - Deep learning library powered by Facebook AI Research.
#

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
# 
# - Addition: 2 + 2 = 4
# - Subtraction: 5 - 3 = 2
# - Multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12
# - Division: 10 / 2 = 5
# - Exponentiation: 2 ** 3 = 8
# - Modulo: 10 % 3 = 1

# In[1]:


# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
(3 * 4) + 5


# In[2]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
200 / 60
